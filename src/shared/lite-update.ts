/**
 * Updating without the installer ("lite update").
 *
 * WHY. The installer is an unsigned exe, and Windows Smart App Control refuses to run one, so on those PCs the
 * installer never starts. It is also the big download (the whole Electron runtime), which is the part that
 * timed out on slow connections. But an update almost never needs it: everything that changes between two
 * releases lives in `resources/app.asar`. The patched Electron runtime only changes when it is re-pinned.
 *
 * So every release also publishes app.asar on its own, plus a small manifest, and the client fetches the file,
 * checks its SHA-512 and swaps it in on restart. It runs nothing new, so there is nothing for Windows to block.
 *
 * WHAT A RELEASE PUBLISHES, beside the installers (scripts/lite-release.mjs):
 *
 *   lite.json                  the manifest below
 *   KRH-Client-<v>.asar        resources/app.asar, exactly as shipped in the installer
 *
 * `runtime` is the pin of the patched Electron build the release was made with. The running app carries its own,
 * baked in at build time, and an app file is only ever swapped in for one built against the same runtime. The day
 * they differ is the day the installer is genuinely needed, and the client falls back to it.
 *
 * Pure, so every check a download has to pass can be tested without one.
