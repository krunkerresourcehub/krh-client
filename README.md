Was AI used in the creation of this client? Yes, if you came across this client and don't want to use it due to that, I highly recommend looking at [Glorp](https://github.com/slavcp/glorp) by slav or [Crankshaft](https://github.com/KraXen72/crankshaft) by KraXen72

## Features

- unlimited FPS with no aim freeze (custom Electron build, see [below](#custom-electron-build))
- unobtrusive — nearly all features can be disabled
- hides ads by default
- resource swapper (textures, sounds, models)
- CSS theme system with `@import` support (drop `.css` files in `swap/themes/`)
- separate CSS themes for social/hub tabs (`swap/socialthemes/`)
- custom loading screen backgrounds (`swap/backgrounds/`)
- sky swapper — recolour the in-game sky, or replace it with an image (`swap/skies/`)
- customizable matchmaker with lobby scan animation
  - filter by region, gamemode, map, player count, remaining time
  - auto-join with server capacity verification
- external ranked queue (works even when the game is closed)
- rank progress tracker with ELO bar and rank distribution popup
- tabbed hub/social pages with drag-and-drop reorder
- better chat — merged team/all chat with `[T]`/`[M]` prefixes
- chat history preservation (Krunker prunes old messages, this prevents it)
- real-time chat translator (Google Translate, 15 languages)
- userscript support (Tampermonkey-style metadata, per-script settings)
- battle pass claim all button
- alt account manager with encrypted credential storage
- Discord RPC (gamemode, map, class, spectator status)
- raw input / unadjusted movement (Windows)
- show numeric ping in player list
- direct server ping option (real TCP round-trip to the game server, not Krunker's estimate)
- hardpoint enemy counter HUD
- keystrokes overlay for streaming (on-screen keyboard + mouse)
- changelog popup on update
- configurable keybinds with visual rebinding dialog
- configurable ANGLE backend (D3D11, OpenGL, D3D11on12)
- advanced Chromium flag tweaks (GPU rasterization, high-performance GPU, debloat, and more)
- auto-updater
- maintained & open source (GPL-3.0)

## Hotkeys

The game hotkeys are rebindable in settings. The tab shortcuts (`Ctrl+T`/`W`/`Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/`1-9`) are fixed. Chat auto-freezes when you scroll up and resumes when you scroll back to the bottom — no key needed.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F4` | New match (triggers matchmaker if enabled) |
| `F5` | Reload page |
| `F6` | Open matchmaker |
| `F9` | Screenshot (copy to clipboard) |
| `F11` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `F12` | DevTools |
| `Ctrl+L` | Copy game link |
| `Ctrl+J` | Join game from clipboard |
| `Ctrl+T` | New tab (hub) |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Previous tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+T` | Reopen closed tab |
| `Ctrl+1-9` | Jump to tab |

## Userscripts

Any `.js` file in the scripts folder will be loaded as a userscript if enabled in settings. Scripts support Tampermonkey-style metadata blocks (`@name`, `@author`, `@version`, `@desc`) and can define custom settings (boolean, number, select, color, keybind).

> **Use userscripts at your own risk.** Do not write or use any userscripts which would give you a competitive advantage.

## Custom Electron Build

This client uses a custom-patched Electron build to overcome the aim freezing issue present in modern Electron versions. The patched binary is downloaded automatically during `npm install`.

For details on the patch and build instructions, see [Electron-Websocket-Fix](https://github.com/bigjakk/Electron-Websocket-Fix).
